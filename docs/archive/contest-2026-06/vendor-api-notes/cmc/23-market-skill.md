# Market Skill

GitHub repo: [coinmarketcap-official/CoinMarketCap-CLI](https://github.com/coinmarketcap-official/CoinMarketCap-CLI)

Use this skill for command-driven crypto market report requests such as market report, market snapshot, crypto morning brief, how's crypto today, or today's crypto market summary.

## Prerequisites

- CoinMarketCap CLI installed and authenticated
- Familiarity with the core [CMC CLI skill](/ai-agent-hub/skills/cmc-cli)

If the runtime is not ready yet, start with the [CoinMarketCap CLI runtime page](/ai-agent-hub/cmc-cli).

## Trigger

Apply when the request matches or clearly implies:
- market report
- market snapshot
- crypto morning brief
- how's crypto today
- today's crypto market summary

## Scope

- Use only shipped `cmc` commands for this report.
- Default commands:
  - `metrics`
  - `price --id 1,1027`
  - `trending`
  - `top-gainers-losers --time-period 24h`
  - `news --limit 5`
- Use `pairs <id> --category derivatives` only when the user explicitly asks for derivatives or an asset-specific derivatives extension.
- Do not switch to MCP or raw Pro API inside this skill.
- Treat `resolve` and `history` as higher-caution, non-default dependencies for this report. Use them only if the request truly needs identity disambiguation or historical context.

## Report Format

Always output these sections in this order:

1. Market Snapshot
2. BTC & ETH
3. Momentum
4. News Flow
5. Risks / Caveats

## Section Rules

- Market Snapshot: summarize the broad tape from `metrics`, `trending`, and `top-gainers-losers`.
- BTC & ETH: anchor on `price --id 1,1027`; keep it tight and comparative.
- Momentum: focus on the strongest movers and what the 24h setup suggests.
- News Flow: use only the top 5 news items and keep it signal-first.
- Risks / Caveats: call out data gaps, stale prints, noisy headlines, and any derivatives caveat if `pairs` was used.

## Failure Handling

- If a command fails, return the affected section with a short partial note instead of dropping the whole report.
- If a command returns incomplete data, say what is missing, use the available subset, and continue to the next section.
- If BTC/ETH data is unavailable, state that explicitly and still complete the remaining sections.

## Style

- Be concise and instruction-focused.
- Prefer report-ready output over explanation.
- Keep the tone suitable for agent task execution, not general assistant chatter.
